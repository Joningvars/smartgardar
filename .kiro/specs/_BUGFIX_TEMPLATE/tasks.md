# Bugfix Implementation Plan

## Overview

<!-- Brief description of the fix approach and verification strategy -->

## AI-Accelerated Effort Estimates

| Complexity | AI-Accelerated | Examples                         |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Simple     | 30min          | Typo fix, config correction      |
| Medium     | 1h             | Logic error, edge case handling  |
| Complex    | 2h             | Race condition, data migration   |
| V.Complex  | 3h             | Architecture fix, security patch |

Format: `_Bugfix ref: BUG-XXX_ | _Effort: 1h_`

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Root Cause Verification
  - [ ] 1.1 Reproduce the bug with a minimal test case
    - Write a failing test that demonstrates the bug
    - _Bugfix ref: BUG-XXX_ | _Effort: 30min_

  - [ ] 1.2 Confirm root cause matches analysis in `bugfix.md`
    - Trace through the code path, verify the root cause
    - _Effort: 30min_

- [ ] 2. Checkpoint — Root cause confirmed, failing test exists

- [ ] 3. Fix Implementation
  - [ ] 3.1 Apply the fix as described in `bugfix.md` scope
    - Implement the minimal change to resolve the bug
    - _Bugfix ref: BUG-XXX_ | _Effort: 1h_

  - [ ] 3.2 Verify the failing test now passes
    - Run the reproduction test, confirm it passes
    - _Effort: 30min_

- [ ] 4. Checkpoint — Fix applied, reproduction test passes

- [ ] 5. Regression Verification
  - [ ] 5.1 Run existing test suite to check for regressions
    - Ensure unchanged behaviour is preserved
    - _Effort: 30min_

  - [ ] 5.2 Add edge case tests if applicable
    - Cover boundary conditions related to the fix
    - _Effort: 30min_

- [ ] 6. Final Checkpoint — All tests pass, no regressions

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Reproduction test (must fail before fix, pass after)
- [ ] Existing unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Edge case tests added (if applicable)
